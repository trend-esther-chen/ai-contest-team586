### Problem Description

Given two integers `m` and `n`, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers more than m and less than or equal to n. Write a function:

```python3
def solution(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    pass
```


### Input

* `m` is lower bound

* `n` is upper bound

### Output

The total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers more than m and less than or equal to n

### Input Example


```
m = 21, n = 100
```


### Output Example

```
8
```

### Constraints

* 0 <= m,n <= 10^9
* m <= n
