The owner of the candy shop want to hold a special discount event, if you have the right answer than you will get the good price. The owner will tell you an array of weights about the candies. You should calculate the sum of the differences of the weights between lightest and heaviest candies in every subarray. 

You need to implement the following function:

```python3
def solution(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    pass
```

### Constraints

1 <= nums.length <= 1000

0 <= nums[i] <= $10^9$


### Example Input

```sh
nums = [3,2,1]
```

### Example Output

```
4
```

### Explaination

The weight array of candies is [3,2,1], the subarrays are [3], [2], [1], [3,2], [2,1], [3,2,1]. The differences of each arrays are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, and the sum of differences is 4.
