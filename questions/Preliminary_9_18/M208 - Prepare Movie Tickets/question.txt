# PrepareMovieTickets  

### Description
At a spring party, each employee gets a ticket with a unique serial number. Before the party begins, there have some warm-up games, one of the warm-up games is matching game. The rule of the matching game is to find another employee that adds your both serial numbers and then the units digit after the addition needs to be equal to the "target" number. The two employees who are successfully matched will get a movie ticket for each and cannot be matched again.  
Given an integer array "nums" representing the ticket number of each employee, return how many movie tickets should the company prepare at least. 

Write a function according to the following example:
```python3
def solution(nums: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    pass
```

### Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>  
0 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>  
0 <= target <= 9

### Example1
input
```sh
nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
target = 8
```
output
```sh
6
 ```

### Example2
input
```sh
nums = [33,23,53,22]
target = 6
```
output
```sh
2
 ```
