# Carpet Factory

### Description
A carpet factory has a major client that has requested the production of square carpets. The purchased fabric comes in an m × n rectangular shape, and in order to optimize production efficiency, the factory aims to minimize the number of cuts required to transform the rectangular fabric into squares.
Return the minimum number of moves needed.

On each move you can select a rectangle and cut it into two rectangles in such a way that all side lengths remain integers.

Write a function according to the following example:
```python3
def solution(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    pass
```

### Constraints
1 ≤ m,n ≤ 500

### Example 1
Input
```
m = 2
n = 8
```
  
Output
```
3 
```
 
Explanation
```
It takes 3 moves to cut a 2x8 rectangle into squares:
-Cut it into 2x2 and 2x6.
-Cut the 2x6 into 2x2 and 2x4.
-Cut the 2x4 into 2x2 and 2x2.
```
