Emma, a mathematics enthusiast, is exploring the fascinating world of consecutive integer sums. She aims to develop a program that, given an integer `num`, can identify three consecutive integers whose sum is equal to `num`. She seeks your aid in achieving this goal.

Your task is to implement a function that accepts an integer `num` as an input and returns a sorted array (in ascending order) of three consecutive integers whose sum equals `num`. If no such set of three consecutive integers exists, the function should return an empty array.

You need to implemment the following function:  

```python3
def solution(num: int) -> list[int]:
    ...
    pass
```

### Constraints

- $0 <= num <= 10^{15}$

### Example 1

```
Input: num = 33
Output: [10, 11, 12]
Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
10, 11, and 12 are three consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: num = 4
Output: []
Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of three consecutive integers.
```
