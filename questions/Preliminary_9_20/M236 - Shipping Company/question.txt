### Description

The shipping company has multiple packages with different weights that need to be transported from Location A to Location B. You are given an integer array `w` which represents the weight of each package. However, there's a weight limit for each trip, given as `n`. Return the minimum number of trips required to transport all the packages.

Write a function according to the following example:
```python3
def solution(n: int, w: list[int]) -> int:
    pass
```

### Constraints
- $1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9$
- $1 ≤ w.Length ≤ 20$
- $1 ≤ w[i] ≤ n$

### Example Input

```
n = 10, w = [4, 7, 6, 2] 
```
 
### Example Output
```
2
```

### Explanation
```
It needs 2 trips at least.  
[4, 6], [7, 2]
```
