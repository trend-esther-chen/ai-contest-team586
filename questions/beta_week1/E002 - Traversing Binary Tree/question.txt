Problem Description:

Given the inorder and postorder traversal results of a binary tree, write a function:

```python3
def solution(inorder: str, postorder: str) -> str:
    pass
```

to output the preorder traversal result.

Input:

The input consists of two strings (lowercase characters, separated by space), each character in the string represents a node. The first string is the result of inorder traversal, and the second one is the result of postorder traversal.

Example:

Input:

"bac", "bca"

Output:

The output is a string representing the result of the preorder traversal.

Example:

Output:

"abc"
