Given a non-empty array `A` of `N` integers (containing only 0s and/or 1s), the consecutive elements of array `A` represent consecutive cars on a road. Each element in array `A` represents a car traveling in a particular direction: 0 represents a car traveling east, and 1 represents a car traveling west.  
  
Write a function:

```python3
def solution(a: list[int]) -> int:
    pass
```

to count the number of passing cars on the road. We consider a pair of cars `(P, Q)`, where `0 â‰¤ P < Q < N`, as passing when `P` is traveling to the east and `Q` is traveling to the west.  
  
## Example  
Consider the array `A` such that:  
  
  A[0] = 0  
  A[1] = 1  
  A[2] = 0  
  A[3] = 1  
  A[4] = 1  
  
We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).  
  
The output for this input should be `5`.  
  
## Input  
The input is a non-empty array `A` consisting of `N` integers (containing only 0s and/or 1s).  
  
## Output  
The output is the number of passing cars.  
  
## Example  
**Input:**  

```
a = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  
```
  
**Output:**  

```
5  
```
