### Problem Description

Little T has recently been a victim of phishing and has decided to study the binary codes used in phishing email transmissions. To simplify the problem, let's assume that the binary code has a length of 8. The binary code is a string where each character is either 0 or 1, such as "11110000" (without quotes). Write a function:

```python3
def solution(bcode: str) -> int:
    pass
```
 
 to help little T would like to know how many 1s there are in a certain phishing email's binary code.  

### Input

The input is only one string, which is a binary code of length 8.

### Output

The output should be an integer representing the number of 1s in the binary code.

### Input Example

```
bcode = "11110000"
```

### Output Example

```
4
```
