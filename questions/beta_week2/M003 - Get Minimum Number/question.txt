### Problem Description

Given a string 'N' representing an 'm'-digit non-negative integer, write a function:

```python3
def solution(n: str, x: int) -> str:
    pass
```

to remove 'x' digits from 'N' to obtain the smallest possible remaining number 'Y'.

### Constraints

* m >= x;
* 'N' will not contain leading zeros.

### Input

There are two inputs. The first input is the string 'N', and the second input is a positive integer 'x'.

### Output

The output should be the string 'Y', representing the smallest possible number after removing 'x' digits.

### Input Example 1

```
n = "1432319"
x = 3
```

### Output Example 1

```
"1219"
```

### Input Example 2

```
n = "2023"
m = 1
```

### Output Example 2

```
"23"
```

Note: The goal is to remove 'x' digits such that the remaining number is as small as possible.
