### Problem Description

In a deck of poker cards (excluding jokers), you randomly draw seven cards. Determine if it's possible to form a straight with five of these cards.

A poker card is defined as a string of two characters where the first character represents the rank (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K) and the second character represents the suit (s,d,c,h). 

Write a function:

```python3
def solution(cards: str) -> str:
    pass
```

to output the lowest possible straight. If multiple straights share the same rank, select the one with the smallest suit. The suit hierarchy is as follows: s > d > c > h.

If a straight cannot be formed, output 'False'.

### Input

The input is a string consisting of seven cards separated by spaces.

### Output

The output should be a string of the five cards that make up the straight, separated by spaces.

### Input Example

```
cards = "As 2d 3d 4h 5s 8c Kc"
```

### Output Example

```
"As 2d 3d 4h 5s"
```

### Note

* A straight is defined as five cards of sequential rank. For example, "Tc Js Qd Kd As" is also a straight and is greater than "9s Tc Js Qd Kd".
* A card with either rank (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K) or suit (s,d,c,h) beyond the scope can't be used.
