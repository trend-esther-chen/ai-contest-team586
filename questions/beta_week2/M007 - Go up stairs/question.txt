### Problem Description

There are n stairs in front of you, some of which are broken. Mr. Zhao can only step one or two stairs at a time. If he steps one stair for the first time, he stands on the first stair; if he steps two stairs for the first time, he stands on the second stair. If Mr. Zhao is not allowed to step on the broken stairs, please write a function:

```python3
def solution(n: int, broken: list[int]) -> int:
    pass
```

to calculate how many ways he can reach the top of the stairs.

### Input

The first input is the total number of stairs n.
The second input is an array, each element in the array represents the position of the broken stairs.

### Input Example

```
n = 3, broken = [1]
```

This means that there are a total of 3 stairs, and there is one broken stair, which is the first stair.

### Output

The total number of different ways to reach the top. If it is impossible to reach the top, output 0.

### Output Example

```
1
```

This means there is only one way to reach the top.
